            <p class="comment more">For the last 8-9 years, I have been making all my investments in mutual funds, through I-solutions only. I have no hesitation in saying that I have always received sound advice and guidance and I am completely satisfied with the performance of my investments. The proof of this is that over the years, I have recommended I-solutions to many of my friends/contacts and all of them, without exception, are very happy.The personal touch that Bhavin and Lokesh provide, their attitude towards all their clients, big or small, their integrity and promptness in service with the smile are difficult to match.
            On this occasion of  I-solutions achieving, successfully the milestone of 10 years, I wish them all success and prosperity in the future.FOR SOLUTIONS TO YOUR INVESTMENT ISSUES, GO TO I-SOLUTIONS.</p>

            <p class="comment more">A decade ago, it was time for me to take over my dad’s long list of investments as he was retiring, came across I-solutions and was blessed to have always being guided rightly.
            With less of greed, but more to take care of clients needs and satisfaction has always been I-solutions right way of moving further at work.
            Been quite lost with quite a few records, I-solutions services have been par excellence and has been my dad’s financial support system all throughout with their right guidance.
            My best wishes and my parent’s blessings truly for Lokesh & Bhavin.
            May you always grow & grow and let your sincerity, honesty and hardwork pay off every bit.
            This year 2018, we Sanghrajka’s celebrate our 10 peaceful years with I-solutions.</p>

            <!-- <span>21 April 2017</span> -->
            <p class="comment more">In 2000 my son with Engineering degree got a job in INFOSYS a well known Software Company in Bangalore. He opened his account In ICICI Bank and suggested me to open a joint account in ICICI Bank Mumbai for easy transfer of money. Ghatkopar (East) was the nearest ICICI Bank Branch from Anushaktinagar where I was staying in BARC colony. We opened this Account in later part of 2000. Noticing good amount in the Account I was advised to invest in ICICI Bank schemes and was introduced to LOKESH who was managing Bank’s Investment Section. With previous investment experience I was vigilant about his advice. With time I realised that he explains all aspects of the Mutual Fund schemes. It is from him that I learned that each scheme invests specific portion in Equity and rest in other options. Specifically investment in Equity determines growth and risk. With time I started understanding these aspects. But the most important aspect that I realised was that here is a person who is educating me about all aspects of the proposed schemes, besides the manner he conduct himself, I realised he is truly my well-wisher. With time our personal relations became very cordial even at family level. My son and daughter who by 2010 were well placed became familiar with Lokesh, his family and business partner Bhavin.
            Today my family appreciates the relationship with I-Solutions Wealth Advisory and the wealth creation achieved by associating with them. During this period because of their dedicated work I-Solutions has achieved remarkable Business Status. We wish them improved pace of progress</p>

            At my office many financial advisor & banker keep chasing us for investments but services treatment and knowledge is almost out of the crowd with Lokesh and Bhavin.On lighter side they keep coming to me on and off to my office, even though I am busy. I meet them, we sit for hours because, I feel stress free with them discussing on many topics like politics, finance, industry.I call for juice for them which is very rare for others. I appreciate their hard work on follow up and continuous visit which was made them successful in their business I wish them good luck for the coming years and their unity.</p>

            <p class="comment more">I met Lokesh before I –Solutions was born.
            Due to busy work schedules, investment strategies and execution was a problem. 
            I used to make very few investments. But I was reluctant to rely on any of the investment advisors, especially as I would do only long term investments. Sometimes I could not express my concerns to them about the investment advices these Advisors would give...

            Lokesh came to me, talked to me initially just to understand how I look at my investments and what have been my expectations and why... Then he discussed and prepared me for charting my goals over next 20-25 years. And then the strategies and investment plans were drawn... Discussed, modified ... And then the execution ... This was very important for me, as it was my ‘Peace Plan’, my Insurance... He became my friend in need ... So when Lokesh and Bhavin started I Solutions, I was there. The team has worked for my investments, have probably tolerated my non-responsiveness on busy work days...Weeks... months... But persuasively got through me. Helped me complete my investments as per plan... Responded with MIS on my investments, Tax computations of investment gains and many tasks along the investments.

            My investment plans as drawn and executed by Lokesh, Bhavin and their team helped me meet my objectives. Realise my Peace Plan irrespective of the turmoils in the stock market.
            All this is because they understand their client, their needs, objectives... Are skilled in guiding the client with appropriate path for long and short term... strike a balance between two. They work with clients not for investments... but for the client’s objectives.. Walk with the client the entire path... from timing the investments, maintaining, monitoring, modifying as per the objective only when required, exiting when appropriate. Relentlessly work for that. 

            Their success story is their clients who do not / would not move out... Have happily relied on them and are still happy about it.</p>

            They also have this openness to new ideas and new ways of doing business –the effort to build a fintech platform is one of the best examples of this –my meetings with them are usually 20% work related and 80% on varied topics –I am sure this openness and innovativeness will help them stay relevant –I am happy that they have reached the 10 year milestone and wish them a lifetime of success and prosperity to themselves and to everyone associated with I –solutions.</p>
