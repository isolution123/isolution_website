            A Mutual Fund is a trust that pools together the savings of a number of investors who share a common financial goal. The money collected is then invested in capital market instruments such as shares, debentures and other securities based on their objective. The income earned through these investments and the capital appreciation realized are shared by its unit holders in proportion to the number of units owned by the investors.

                    </li>

                    <ul class="sub-ul-style">
                      <li>
                        Fees:
                        <p>The salary of the market analysts and fund manager comes from the investors along with the operational costs of the fund.

                            Exit Load:                
                            <p>You have exit load as fees charged by AMCs when exiting a mutual fund. It discourages investors from redeeming investments for some time. It also helps the fund manager garner the required funds to purchase the appropriate securities at the right price and time.</p>

                              <p> STPs allows you to earn higher returns on your investments by shifting to a more profitable venture during market swings. Gaining market advantage in this method maximizes the profits through securities bought and sold in the capital sector.</p>

Rupee Cost Averaging follows the technique of investing in funds when their average price is low and selling them when their market value increases, thereby realizing capital gains on the individual securities.</p>

The fund would be open for subscription only during a specified period and there is an even balance of buyers and sellers, so someone would have to be selling in order for you to be able to buy it. Closed-end funds are also listed on the stock exchange so it is traded just like other stocks on an exchange or over the counter. Usually the redemption is also specified which means that they terminate on specified dates when the investors can redeem their units.</p>
